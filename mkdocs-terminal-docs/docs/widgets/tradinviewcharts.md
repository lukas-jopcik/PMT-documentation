#### Technical Charts
The chart interface provides a flexible set of tools for customizing your view of the markets. Here's a breakdown of the available options:

##### Select Module
- Choose the type of market data or module you wish to view. For Forex traders, this would typically be the Forex module, allowing you to view currency pairs and related data. Also we provide data for Commodities, Indices nad US Stocks.
##### Select Symbol
- Select the specific symbol you wish to analyze. 
##### Select Interval
- Set the time interval for your chart. You can choose from various intervals to view the price action over different timeframes.
##### Select Saved Chart or Create New Layout
- If you've previously saved any chart layouts, you can select them from this option. This allows you to quickly reload your preferred configurations and settings, saving time on chart customization.
- If you'd like to start fresh or design a new layout, you can use the Create New Layout option. This will allow you to create a customized view of your chart with all the indicators, symbols, and settings you need.
##### Enter Layout Name
- Once you've customized your chart layout, you can name it for easy future access. The Enter Layout Name field allows you to save your layout under a specific title for organization and quick retrieval later on.

#### Overview and Mini Charts
The Overview and Mini Charts provide quick snapshots of the current market movement without the ability to draw on the charts using TradingView tools. These are ideal for overviews where you need a fast glance at the price action and market trends.

You have the same options available as in the Technical Chart, but with a simplified interface. You can select the Module (e.g., Forex) and choose the Symbol (currency pair) for display. Additionally, you can adjust the time interval to suit your needs, allowing for a tailored view of price movement over your chosen timeframe.

These charts are perfect for monitoring real-time price changes without the complexity of detailed charting tools, making them an efficient tool for quick market insights.
